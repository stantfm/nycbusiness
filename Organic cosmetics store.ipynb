I already have the prototypes for the cosmetics and a great website but am now looking for a good small commercial store in New York City from where I can start selling my physical products.\n\n# Here the criterias I am looking for to find the best possible location for my organic cosmetics shop:\n\n# - Space Size: between 300 and 700 square feet\n# - Location should be near other commercial stores in NYC\n# - Rent price: the least expensive as possible\n# - Location should be near places that have been rated by people who like organic products\n\n# To find the best possible place I will use Foursquare location data and people's reviews. \n\n\n\n# 2) DATA SECTION => Examples of Foursquare data I am planning to use:\n# Venues in NYC that are for commercial use between 300 and 700 feet big\n# Venues that are located / concentrated around other venues\n# The Price of Venues with the lowest as possible rent if I can find it\n# look at Venues that have been highly rated by users\n# Users who like and have reviewed organic products in NYC to find out where these places and people are\n"
